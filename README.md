# Limb Tracking Project

This script utilizes the MediaPipe library to detect and track human poses in video sequences. The script reads an input video, performs pose estimation on each frame, visualizes the landmarks and connections between joints, and then writes the annotated frames to an output video. The example provided specifically works with a video of a quarterback during his pro day.
